## 🚀 Current Projects  

### 📱 **Pause – Mobile App + NFC Device**  
A mobile application that, together with a **physical NFC tag**, helps you build a real, tangible barrier between you and distracting apps on your phone.  

The idea is simple: by interacting with a physical object, you intentionally switch into a focused mode — making digital distractions harder to access and helping you stay present.

The app is developed for both major mobile platforms:  
- **iOS (Swift):** https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/pause-distractions/id6752442147  
- **Android (Kotlin):** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.paused&hl=pl  

There is also a **dedicated website for the project**, built with **React, WordPress, and WooCommerce**, which serves both as an informational page and an online store for the NFC device:  
👉 https://paused.pl/

> ⚠️ Note: the website may not be fully functional at the moment, as I am currently implementing a new store backend in **Node.js**.
